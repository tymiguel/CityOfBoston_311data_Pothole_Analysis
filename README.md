Prediction of pothole reports in 311 app

This report summarizes the time series and methods used in forecasting the number of pothole repair requests the City of Boston will receive. The purpose of this report is to document the opportunities there are to use Box-Jenkins methods, specifically, ARIMA models, to model pothole repair requests to better enable public works departments to react and remedy unsatisfactory road conditions, decreasing the time from complaint to completion.

According to the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) “Smart Growth America, Repair Priorities 2014” it is estimated that every $1 spent to keep a road in good condition saves about $6 - $14 that would be needed later to rebuild the same road after greater deterioration. Additionally, a 2016 survey conducted by the American Automobile Association (AAA) found that 15% of U.S. drivers (60 million people) have spent $15 billion over the last five years for vehicle repairs due to pothole damage. Furthermore, a driver that had experienced pothole damage that required car repair was more likely to have had it happen more than once, an average of three times in the last 5 years. 

From the aforementioned facts, we deduced that potholes were generally clustered in the same spaces where the same motorists would be more likely to experience car damage and public works departments would be more likely to focus their improvement efforts. Therefore, we believe that using time series modeling to predict roadway defects that would need to be remedied by local municipalities could improve roadway conditions, decrease costs to motorists and government, and improve satisfaction rates of constituents.

Note: This report is complete, however the final product still needs to be updated on Github (the update is happening slowly).
